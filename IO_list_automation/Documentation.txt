Aplication buttons:
	File
		Save					- saves currently sellected list: Desigh, IO list, Objects 
		Save all				- saves all list 
		Load					- loads one list from file
		Load all				- loads all lists from same file name
		Help					
		About
		Test_aplication			- runs all functions and compares results with data that is working
		Exit					- exits application
	Project
		Design					- Reads selected .xls file and extracts useful information, column data 0 - number; 1 - Cabinet; 2 - Module_name; 3 - Pin; 4 - Channel; 5 - IO_text; 6 - Page; 7 - Changed (in new revision)
								if no data in module or channel, that line of data is not useful and it is deleted
		IO compare				- Compares new .xls file with existing data in design tab
		Transfer Data to Signals- Transfers all data from design tab to IO list, extracting data from IO text
									1 word should be KKS of signal (192HLB10AA151, etc.)
									words until ; or : are object name that belongs to this signal (ID fan, etc.)
									words between ; and : are objects detailed description (frequency converter, etc.)
									words after : are signal function
		CPU select				- Selects CPU that is used for controlling
		SCADA select			- Selects SCADA system
		Language select			- Select language that is used for IO_list
	Signals
		KKS edit				- Edits KKS, can remove x first symbols, remove y end symbols, add underscore between first 4 symbols
		Find function			- Finds function of signal based on learning files
		Multi cpu				- Configure what modules belong to which CPU
	Uniques
		Find uniques			- Find unique KKS symbols and this means that there is unique object
		Find objects			- Find what kind of object type this object belongs based on learning files
